 * Fault reporting for the loaded module.

 * A crash inside the loaded ARM library is invisible from the outside: the process
 * has no debugger, the .so is not on disk, and qemu only reports the faulting
 * address. Naming the faulting instruction's offset inside the module is what
 * turns "segfault at 0x4" into something objdump can answer.
